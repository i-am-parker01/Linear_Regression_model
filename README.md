# Linear Regression Model: Height and Weight Prediction

This project demonstrates the application of a linear regression model to predict the height of individuals based on their weight or vice-versa. The dataset consists of the heights and weights of several individuals, and the goal is to create a model that can predict weight from height.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
1. Collected data on heights and weights of individuals.
2. Applied linear regression to create a model that predicts weight based on height.
3. Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
4. Visualized the results to understand how well the model fits the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains two main columns:
- **Height**: The height of an individual in centimeters.
- **Weight**: The weight of an individual in kilograms.

This data was used to train and test the linear regression model.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing the linear regression model.

## Installation
